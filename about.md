**Interpret This** is a blog about the science, philosophy and history of interpretation!

## Why Interpretation?

I find interpretation to be one of the most fascinating processes in the world! Somehow our brain is able to convert raw sensory data into an enriching and meaningful experience. Just as fascinating is the fact that our world is interpretable by our tiny human brains. I want to explore these ideas and more through a series of essays ranging from Chess to Constitutional Law.

## Why the shoe?

The winged sandal, or Talaria, is a reference to Hermes, the Greek god of... many things. In the Hellenistic period, Hermes was identified with the Egyptian god Thoth and became associated with interpretation and translation. Today, the legacy of Hermes lives on in the field of hermeneutics, the philosophical study of interpretation.

Although the ideas explored in this blog extend far beyond traditional hermeneutics, I wanted to pay homage to its dedication to recognizing interpretation as a topic worthy of study in itself.

## Who are you?

My name is James Boyer and I am a mathematician with a passion for science, music, philosophy, and communication! I got my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Dallas and now work as a Data Scientist. I also have years of experience in competitive debate particularly in Moot Court. These experiences were formative for me in realizing the importance of interpretation in the human experieince.

## What are the goals of this blog?

I have two main goals:

1. To explore ideas that I find to be personally meaningful and hope will be impactful to others.
2. I am interested in science journalism as a career and want to use this blog as an avenue for building experience in this domain.
