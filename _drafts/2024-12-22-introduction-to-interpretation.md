## What is interpretation?

This seemingly simple question is one that is the driving motivation for this entire blog. Interpretation is exactly that process which allows us to experience all the wonders and joys of life. Without interpretation, it is difficult to even imagine what life would even be like. Furthermore, it is astounding to me that life can be interpreted at all! That our world is so complicated and yet comprehensible is something we cannot take for granted. For these reasons and more, I've decieded to create this blog as part of a quest to understand the mystery of interpretation.

This first post is a short attempt to define interpretation. I hope it will exemplify the challenge of doing so while also demonstrating the interesting questions that arise when doing so. This definition is by no means rigorous and in fact I struggled to even put it down in this form. I hope in future posts to return to this definition and refine it as my understanding improves.

With the expectations set, my first working definition of interpretation is as follows...

**Interpretation is the process by which a subject transforms objects into meaning.**

This definition includes four key ideas: subject, transforms, objects and meaning. We consider each of these in turn. Each of these definitions builds on the previous one.

Let us first consider the word **subject**.

### Subject

I wasn't sure whether to include the word subject at first but eventually I realized that interpretation is meaningless without one. Without a subject, my definition would devolve to some random statement about transformation which is absurdly broad.

We life life as subjects with a particular viewpoint into the world. It is this notion of viewpoint that I've decided to base my definition on. I also wanted to keep the definition broad enough to entail unconventional but I think still relevant cases of interpretation such as a bacteria performing chemotaxis or a thermostat regulating temperature.

**A subject is anything with a point of view.**

### Objects

Objects can take many forms including...
* Sensory data like visual or sonic stimuli
* Formalisms like those found in mathematics or algorithms
* Natural Language
* Thoughts themselves

I originally wanted to use the word data instead of objects but I felt that data was difficult to define and that object essentially captured what I wanted. By object, I also intend to include objects of our own subjectivity including thoughts and emotions. In this way, the subject might also be its own object through the process of metacognition. 

I also want to clarify that my definition of objects is not to suggest that the mind creates reality or that nothing exists outside what one observes. Rather, I mean that for the sake of interpretation, an object only has relevance if it interacts with the subject. A deeper question is to what extent are the objects we observe are connected to a real external reality.

**Objects are anything that a subject observes or experiences.**

### Transforms

A transformation (or interpretive schema / framework) is a function applied by a subject to objects that result in a new object to be observed by the subject. An important clarification is that the transformation does not have to be performed consciously. It is merely a change enacted by whatever we may call the subject.

**A transformation is any change applied to objects observed by the subject.**

### Meaning

Meaning is the resulting object after the transformation. In this sense, meaning is a type of object  Oftentimes, there are associations that meaning has to be related to action but I find this to be likely unecessary. While it may be the case that meaning is associated with an action, this does not mean that meaning is for no other purpose then for creating action.

**Meaning is the result of the transformation applied by the subject.**

## Open Questions

These overly simplified definitions raise a variety of questions...

* How do the meanings we create relate to external reality?
* What about reality allows us to creative effective representations?
* To what extent are observed objects independent of the subject and how do we guarantee as much?
* What types of transformations are possible? Do these transformations have theoretical justifications?

My head is already starting to spin trying to write this post so I think I will end here and rewrite a better version later.

## Personal Note about the Blog

A maxim I have come up with for myself is **Something is better than nothing.** An idea / plan / project unexecuted is none at all. This more helps with my perfectionist ideas but it really means that a simple idea shared is better than an amazing one never expressed.


After a long bit of tediously beating around the bush, I am finally starting this blog. I have been wanting to do this for awhile but I have kept distracting myself by endlessly trying to find the best website framework to use. I have settled down and am now committing to a framework built on Jekyll which will allow the possibility of future customizations while also allowing me to deploy the website on GitHub. I am also restraining myself from pursuing an overly abitious fictional setting for this blog though I hope to perhaps return to that idea at a future date.
